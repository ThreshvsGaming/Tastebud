## Project Reflections
### Highlights of Our Success
• Teamwork and Collaboration: Our team excelled in working together and building off each other's strengths. The high level of communication and openness to feedback was central to our harmonious collaboration.
• Feature Implementation: We successfully implemented a significant amount of features we initially aimed for. This achievement reflects our ability to translate conceptual ideas into functional realities.
• Deadline Management: We managed our deadlines effectively, which helped us stay organized, maintain productivity, and deliver quality work in a timely manner.
### Areas of Improvement
	• Planning for the Unexpected: We realized the importance of thoroughly planning for unexpected events and contingencies. A more detailed anticipation of assignment-specific issues would have improved our ability to adapt to unforeseen challenges.
### Lessons for Future Projects
• Prior Knowledge: To make the development process smoother, acquiring an understanding of Android development before the start of the course would have been beneficial. This would allow us to start coding more efficiently right from the beginning.
• Team Bonding: Additionally, spending more casual time together as a team, or "hanging out with the homies," could also improve our rapport and synergy. This can foster a more cohesive, supportive, and enjoyable work environment for future projects.
