## List of Project Contributors and Their Roles
- Bricz: Bricz played a critical role in the project by working on Android intents and activities. He learned a lot in this area and gave us some great pointers when refactoring several things in our project!
- Safran: Safran took charge of managing XML files and crafting many aspects of the UI, especially image handling.
- Zhihao: Zhihao was responsible for conducting acceptance tests. He created many of the system and integration tests, helping us refine our codebase and crafting a well-made app.
- Aj: Aj focused on learning and implementing Android-specific dependencies, working with XML files, and developing a three-tiered architectural system.
- Lyle: Lyle focused on learning about Android intents and UI, contributing the Edit page among others, helping create a solid app.
## Project Reflections
### Highlights of Our Success
- Teamwork and Collaboration: Our team excelled in working together and building off each other's strengths. The high level of communication and openness to feedback was central to our success.
- Feature Implementation: We successfully implemented a significant amount of features we initially aimed for. This achievement reflected our ability to create realistic goals for ourselves.
- Deadline Management: We managed our deadlines effectively, which helped us stay organized, maintain productivity, and deliver quality work in a timely manner.
### Areas of Improvement
- Planning for the Unexpected: We realized the importance of thoroughly planning for unexpected events. We often pushed up right against deadlines when there were aspects of iterations that we missed in the rubric. A more detail-oriented approach to planning would have served us much better.
### Lessons for Future Projects
- Prior Knowledge: To make the development process smoother, acquiring an understanding of Android development before the start of the course would have made the development much easier. This would have allowed us to start coding more efficiently right from the beginning.
- Team Bonding: Hanging out with the homies! - i.e., bonding with our team - could have improved our morale and rapport. We learned how to work together well, but having more time to socialize and get to know each other outside of class could have made the project much smoother.
