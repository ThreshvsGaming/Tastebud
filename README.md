## What is TasteBud? 

TasteBud is a storage app that allows you to locally store a collection of recipes within your phone. The app allows users to create a detailed description, from cooking procedures, necessary ingredients, and user-inserted photos of the desired food. For convenience, we allow users to edit recipes. When searching through a large list of recipes, users will be able to narrow down their search via name, ingredients, meals of the day, etc. Additionally, users will be able to rate and share their recipes. 

 
## Who is TasteBud for?  

TasteBud is designed for individuals across a wide range of cooking abilities. It is made for novice home cooks, experienced chefs, or even busy parents looking to organize their go-to meals. This app serves as a valuable tool for those who find themselves experimenting with a diverse range of foods and struggle to keep track of their ever growing recipe collection. With TasteBud, forgetting a recipe is no longer a problem, as it provides a viable solution for storing all your recipes in one accessible place. 

## Why is TasteBud valuable?  

TasteBud's value comes from the ease of use the app provides. The app acts like an all-in-one library for recipes, making it simpler for users to find their favorites. Since TasteBud is an app that acts like a centralized home for your cuisine, it can be taken anywhere â€“ whether you are at home or in a professional kitchen. Users will avoid needing to flip through expensive cookbooks or waste time trying to Google for a specific recipe. TasteBud also allows users to find recipes based on ingredients, avoiding the problem of not knowing what to make with what you have on hand. 

## How will TasteBud be successful?  

TasteBud will be considered a success based on 3 objectives. First, whether or not the users find TasteBud to be more convenient to use than anything else that is available on the market. This will be determined from a survey that the users will be asked to take after 3 weeks of use, and we are hoping to see at least a 10% improvement in convenience ratings compared to existing systems currently available.  Second, users should find searching for their favorite recipes simple and accurate, and we are hoping to see users picking the first recipe after searching 30% of the time. The last objective is at least 50% of the users decisively picking TasteBud over other competitors, as determined from the survey. If any two out of these three objectives are met, TasteBud will be considered a successful project.
